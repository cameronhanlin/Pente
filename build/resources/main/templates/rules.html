    <h2>How to take a turn:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Players take turns placing one piece on the board. Click where you would like your piece to be set.</li>
        <li>The pieces are placed on the intersections of the lines, rather than inside the squares.</li>
        <li>The first play is always in the center of the board.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The first Player is chosen at random.</li>
            <li>Click anywhere inside the board to start play.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>How to win:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The object of the game is to either get five pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) or capture five of your opponent's pairs.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The first Player to reach either objective, wins immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Captures are made by surrounding two of your opponents' pieces (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) with two of your pieces, with one on each side.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A player's pieces cannot be captured by moving in-between two of their opponent's existing pieces.</li>
            <li>Multiple captures when placing a single piece is allowed.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
